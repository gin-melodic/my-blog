Introduction: The Vertical Revolution in Hardcore Mobile Gaming

As of October 25, 2025, the mobile gaming landscape has firmly shed its reputation as a domain exclusive to casual, ephemeral experiences. The market is now defined by a mature, discerning audience that demands deep, strategically rich gameplay that seamlessly integrates into a mobile-first lifestyle. This has given rise to the "vertical revolution," a surge in demand for high-quality games playable with a single hand in portrait mode, perfectly suited for short, engaging sessions or longer, more focused play.[1]
At the forefront of this movement is the roguelike genre. Its core tenets—procedurally generated levels, the high stakes of permadeath, and compelling meta-progression systems—create an endlessly replayable "one more run" loop that is uniquely suited to the mobile platform.[2, 3] These games reward skill, strategic thinking, and persistence, offering the kind of hardcore challenge that players increasingly seek on their primary gaming device.
However, the 2025 mobile roguelike market is sharply bifurcated. It is a landscape of competing monetization philosophies, from premium, player-respecting titles to free-to-play (F2P) models of varying ethical standards.[4, 5] Navigating this space requires careful analysis. This report provides a definitive guide to the best vertical roguelike experiences available today, adopting a player-first philosophy that prioritizes gameplay value, developer transparency, and fair monetization. The analysis is based exclusively on global market data and English-language sources from 2025, deliberately excluding the distinct ecosystem of mainland China to provide a focused, relevant perspective for the international player.
Part I: The Premium Standard — Pay Once, Play Endlessly
This section champions the purest form of mobile gaming excellence: the premium model. These are titles that respect the player's investment by offering a complete, uncompromised experience for a single upfront price, free from the pressures of in-app purchases or advertisements. They represent the benchmark against which all other models should be measured.
In-Depth Feature: Slice & Dice — The Dice-Rolling Masterclass
Slice & Dice stands as a paragon of modern mobile game design, a masterclass in balancing strategic depth with controlled randomness.[6, 7] Its core concept is both simple and brilliant: players control a party of five heroes, where each hero is represented by a unique, customizable six-sided die. Combat is a turn-based affair where enemy actions are revealed in advance, transforming each turn into a complex "mini-puzzle" of risk management and tactical decision-making.[8] The game's minimalist yet charming pixel art and exceptionally clear user interface make it perfectly suited for vertical play, though it also offers a landscape mode for flexibility.[1, 8]
The game's monetization model is arguably the gold standard for the 2025 mobile market. It operates on a "demo-to-premium" basis: the game is free to download and play for the first 12 levels, offering a substantial taste of the core mechanics. A single in-app purchase of approximately $9 unlocks the full, sprawling experience.[6, 9] This approach builds immense player trust, allowing for an informed purchase and ensuring a committed user base. In an industry rife with opaque F2P systems, this transparency is a breath of fresh air.
The value proposition of that single purchase is immense. The full game unlocks over 60 hero classes, nearly 500 unique items, and more than 300 difficulty modifiers, providing a staggering level of replayability that rivals and, in some respects, surpasses its peers.[8, 10] While some veteran players have noted the steep jump between difficulty tiers and expressed a desire for a more granular progression system akin to the "Ascension" levels in Slay the Spire, the sheer variety of potential party compositions and item synergies ensures that no two runs are ever the same.[11] For players who value pure strategy and a fair price, Slice & Dice is an essential purchase.
In-Depth Feature: Wildfrost — The Deeply Strategic Deckbuilder
For players seeking a deckbuilding experience with profound tactical depth, Wildfrost has established itself as a premier title in 2025.[12] It successfully carves its own niche, moving beyond the foundational mechanics of Slay the Spire by introducing a multi-lane battlefield and its innovative "counter" system. In Wildfrost, allied and enemy units possess timers that tick down each time the player plays a card; once the counter hits zero, the unit acts.[12, 13] This mechanic transforms the game from a simple card-playing exercise into a complex temporal puzzle, where turn order, unit placement, and resource management are paramount.
Following the player-friendly trend, Wildfrost employs a "free-to-try" model. Players can download and experience the initial part of the game at no cost, with a single in-app purchase of approximately $6.99 unlocking the full game.[12, 14, 15] This model has proven successful in attracting players who may be wary of a blind purchase but are willing to pay for a high-quality, complete product.
The mobile version has been specifically optimized with an updated user interface for smaller screens and fully supports portrait mode, making its deep, strategic gameplay accessible on the go.[15, 16] However, its high-quality animations and complex calculations can be demanding on device resources, with some reports of phones running hot during extended play sessions.[12, 13] Despite this, for those with capable hardware, Wildfrost offers one of the most intellectually rewarding roguelike experiences on any platform.
The Innovator's Choice: Vault of the Void
Vault of the Void is a deckbuilder crafted for the strategist who loathes the tyranny of the random number generator (RNG).[12, 17] Its design philosophy is centered on giving the player maximum information and control. Key mechanics that set it apart include the ability to preview all enemies on a floor before engaging, the freedom to modify your deck at any point between battles, and a unique "Threat" system that clearly displays incoming damage, removing guesswork from defensive calculations.[17, 18]
This title is a pure premium experience, available for a one-time purchase of around $6.99.[19, 20] Reinforcing its commitment to a fair player experience, the game also offers a completely optional $2.99 supporter pack that provides no gameplay advantages whatsoever.[18]
However, a critical caveat exists for players seeking a vertical experience. The game's App Store listing explicitly states it is "Designed for iPad," and numerous user reviews from 2025 cite a "mid mobile UX" on phones, where the interface can feel cramped and lead to accidental card plays.[20, 21] The game's layout is heavily optimized for a wider, landscape aspect ratio. While it is a top-tier deckbuilder, it does not fulfill the vertical play requirement and is best enjoyed on a tablet.
Other Essential Purchases
For a complete library, two other premium vertical roguelikes are considered timeless classics in 2025:
 * Crypt of the NecroDancer: The game that masterfully fused the roguelike with the rhythm genre. Every action—moving and attacking—must be performed to the beat of the game's incredibly catchy soundtrack. This rhythmic, turn-based gameplay is perfectly executed on mobile with simple tap-based controls, making it an ideal vertical experience.[22, 23]
 * Downwell: A masterclass in minimalist design and pure, distilled action. Players descend a procedurally generated well, using their "Gunboots" to shoot enemies and slow their fall. The gameplay is fast, frantic, and entirely vertical, making it the perfect game for short, adrenaline-fueled sessions.[23]
The success of the "Demo-to-Premium" model used by Slice & Dice and Wildfrost is indicative of a maturing mobile market. Pure premium games often struggle with discoverability in app stores dominated by the "Free" filter. Conversely, many F2P games solve this issue but must then implement monetization systems that can feel coercive. The demo model offers a powerful third way: it leverages the visibility of a free listing to attract a wide audience, then converts the most engaged players into paying customers by demonstrating the game's quality directly. This builds a foundation of trust and proves that a significant segment of the mobile audience is willing to pay for a complete, high-quality product, provided they are given the chance to verify its value first.
Part II: The F2P Vanguard — Excellence Without Expense
While the premium market offers guaranteed quality, the free-to-play space in 2025 is home to some of the most innovative and popular roguelikes available. Success in this arena, however, requires a careful understanding of each game's monetization model. This section analyzes the best F2P titles, providing detailed strategic guidance for both zero-spend and low-spend players.
In-Depth Feature: Vampire Survivors — The Genre King's Continued Reign
Vampire Survivors is more than a game; it is a phenomenon. It single-handedly created and defined the "bullet heaven" subgenre, and its influence is felt across the industry.[23, 24] Its core gameplay loop is deceptively simple: the player moves their character with one finger while weapons fire automatically. This minimalist control scheme makes it the quintessential vertical-screen game, perfectly designed for single-handed play.[1, 25] The addictive cycle of surviving ever-denser hordes of monsters, collecting experience gems, and evolving a build of weapons and passives into a screen-clearing cataclysm remains as compelling in late 2025 as it was at launch.[3, 23]
The most significant development for the game in 2025 is the impending arrival of the v1.14 update. Scheduled for release this fall, this update will introduce a highly anticipated online co-op mode for up to four players, expanding the game beyond its single-player and local co-op roots.[26, 27] While the mobile port is generally excellent, players should be aware of two common complaints: noticeable input lag during the most graphically intense late-game moments, and the lack of a mid-run save feature, which can be frustrating for players who are interrupted.[25]
F2P and Low-Spender Guide
 * Monetization Model: Vampire Survivors employs one of the most ethical F2P models on the market. The vast base game is entirely free. Revenue is generated through optional, low-priced downloadable content (DLC) packs that add new characters, stages, weapons, and music, functioning as content expansions rather than pay-to-win advantages.[28, 29]
 * Guidance for 0-Kryo (F2P) Players: The base game provides dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of content. The primary F2P progression path involves efficiently farming gold to purchase permanent upgrades from the "PowerUp" menu. The most critical early investments for accelerating progression are Greed (more gold), Growth (more experience), Luck (improves level-up choices and drops), and Cooldown Reduction. A crucial feature for experimentation is the ability to refund all PowerUp points for free at any time, allowing players to re-spec their build without penalty.[25]
 * Guidance for Wei-Kryo (Low-Spender) Players: The DLCs represent outstanding value for money. The recommended strategy is to play through and unlock the majority of the base game's content first. Once that is exhausted, purchasing the DLCs is an excellent way to support the developer and inject a massive amount of new content into the experience, significantly extending its lifespan.
In-Depth Feature: Shattered Pixel Dungeon — The Open-Source Champion
Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a testament to the power of community-driven development. It stands as a pillar of the traditional, turn-based roguelike genre on mobile.[1, 30, 31] What began in 2014 as a mod to rebalance the original Pixel Dungeon has, over a decade of continuous updates, evolved into a deep, polished, and distinct game in its own right.[30, 32, 33] It is celebrated for its strategic depth, challenging gameplay, and complete absence of predatory monetization.
The game's developer maintains a public roadmap, offering a rare degree of transparency. The major updates for 2025 have included the release of the sixth playable hero, the Cleric, with plans later in the year for a new quest set in the Dwarven City and balance improvements for the Warrior class.[32] This consistent, long-term support has cultivated a dedicated and passionate player base.
F2P and Low-Spender Guide
 * Monetization Model: Shattered Pixel Dungeon features a unique dual-platform monetization strategy. On the Google Play Store for Android, the game is completely free, with no ads and no in-app purchases.[30, 34, 35] It is a true passion project. On the Apple App Store for iOS, it is sold as a premium title for a one-time price of $4.99 to cover development and platform costs.[36, 37]
 * Guidance for 0-Kryo (F2P) Players (Android): As there are no spending mechanics, this guide focuses purely on gameplay strategy. New players are advised to begin with the Warrior class due to his starting armor and higher durability, which makes the punishing early floors more manageable.[38] Key beginner strategies include: learning to identify potions by testing them on safe floors away from enemies; using doorways to guarantee surprise attacks on pursuing monsters; and carefully observing enemy attack patterns to know when to fight and when to flee. The game has a steep learning curve, and players are encouraged to consult the extensive community-written guides available online.[39, 40]
Analysis: Shadow of the Depth — A Promising but Cautionary Tale
Hailing from ChillyRoom, the acclaimed developers of Soul Knight, Shadow of the Depth is a top-down action roguelike with a strong foundation.[41, 42] The game boasts fast-paced, satisfying hack-and-slash combat, a moody, hand-drawn art style, and a deep build-crafting system that combines over 140 passive abilities with character-specific talents and a rune system.[43, 44]
However, its monetization model is a step toward the more aggressive end of the F2P spectrum. The game is free with ads and in-app purchases that focus on selling additional playable characters and the premium currency required to unlock them.[41, 45] Several user reviews in 2025 have criticized what they term "deceptive charging practices." Specifically, the premium currency packs are sized in such a way that a player cannot purchase a single hero without buying an oversized, more expensive pack, leaving them with an awkward amount of leftover currency—a classic F2P tactic designed to encourage further spending.[44] While the core gameplay is strong, this approach may alienate players accustomed to more transparent models. Furthermore, its top-down action perspective is best suited for landscape play, and there is no evidence it supports a dedicated vertical mode, placing it outside the user's core request.[41, 45]
F2P and Low-Spender Guide
 * Guidance for 0-Kryo (F2P) Players: The most viable F2P path is to fully master the starting character, Arthur the Warrior.[43, 44] Progression for F2P players is tied to the rune system; runes can be acquired slowly through gameplay or more quickly by watching incentivized video ads. Leveraging this ad system is the primary method for F2P players to build power over time.[41]
 * Guidance for Wei-Kryo (Low-Spender) Players: The single most valuable purchase is the one-time IAP to remove forced advertisements.[44] For those looking to spend a small amount, the introductory "Novice Pack" at $0.99 likely offers the best initial value.[45] Players should be cautious about purchasing the larger currency packs unless they are deeply invested in the game and comfortable with the pricing structure.
The F2P roguelike landscape of 2025 clearly illustrates a spectrum of developer philosophies. At one end, Vampire Survivors and Shattered Pixel Dungeon represent a player-centric approach. The former monetizes by selling more high-quality content, treating players like customers. The latter, on Android, is a pure passion project. At the other end, games like Shadow of the Depth employ more traditional F2P mechanics that create friction and incentivize spending to overcome it. This reveals a fundamental difference in how developers view their audience: as customers to be delighted or as a resource to be monetized. The resounding success of the former models suggests a market that is increasingly rewarding transparency and value.
Part III: The Market Pulse — Trends, Titans, and What's Next
To fully understand the vertical roguelike space, one must also consider the influential titans of the genre that shape player expectations, even if they do not perfectly align with the single-handed playstyle.
The Elephant in the Room: Balatro and the Wait for Portrait Mode
No discussion of the 2025 roguelike scene is complete without acknowledging Balatro. This poker-based deckbuilder was the breakout indie sensation of 2024, captivating the entire gaming world with its ingenious design and addictive synergies.[23, 34, 46] Its success was officially recognized when it won the prestigious People's Choice award at the Pocket Gamer Mobile Games Awards 2025.[47]
Despite its massive popularity and critical acclaim on mobile, the game has one significant drawback that prevents it from being a top recommendation in this report: it lacks a portrait mode.[1, 48] A vertical orientation is one of the most frequently requested features from the mobile community, and its current landscape-only format is a considerable barrier for players seeking a true one-handed experience.
Adding to this, major news broke in September 2025: the game's first major content update, version 1.1, will not be released in 2025 as previously promised.[49, 50] The solo developer, LocalThunk, released a heartfelt statement explaining that as a "hobbyist developer at heart," he wanted to avoid the stress and crunch that plagued the game's launch and instead work at a healthy, sustainable pace.[49, 50] The new timeline is simply "it's done when it's done." This story has become a significant talking point in the industry regarding indie developer health and the importance of managing community expectations after a viral success.
Honorable Mentions & Landscape Legends
 * Slay the Spire: The game that single-handedly revitalized and defined the modern deckbuilding roguelike genre.[12, 23, 30] It remains the benchmark for balance, design, and replayability. While its mobile port is excellent, the user interface is heavily optimized for landscape play, making it less than ideal for the specific needs of this report.
 * Dead Cells: A masterpiece that seamlessly blends fast-paced roguelite action with Metroidvania-style exploration and progression.[23, 30, 36] It is a premium title with an incredible amount of content, but as a side-scrolling action-platformer, it is a landscape-only experience.
 * The Netflix Effect: A growing trend in 2025 is the influence of gaming subscription services. Netflix Games, in particular, has become a significant publisher of high-quality mobile titles. By including celebrated games like Hades, Into The Breach, and Dead Cells as part of its subscription, it provides an alternative avenue for players to access premium, IAP-free experiences, further raising the bar for quality on the platform.[23, 51]
Concluding Analysis: The Future of Mobile Roguelikes
The state of the vertical roguelike genre in late 2025 is exceptionally strong. The market is mature enough to support a healthy ecosystem of both premium masterpieces and ethical free-to-play champions, giving discerning players more high-quality choices than ever before.
Several key trends will define the genre moving into 2026. First, the success of the "Demo-to-Premium" model is proving to be a sustainable and player-friendly strategy that bridges the gap between free and paid games. Second, developer transparency—whether through public roadmaps like Shattered Pixel Dungeon's or honest communication about delays like Balatro's—is becoming a critical factor in building long-term community trust. Finally, the demand for deep, mechanically rich, vertical-first experiences will only continue to grow as developers recognize the unique strengths of the mobile platform. While technologies like AI-driven personalization will become more prevalent in F2P monetization, the ultimate arbiters of success will be the players themselves, who have repeatedly shown they will reward developers who respect their time, intelligence, and wallets.[5, 52]

2025年末手机竖屏Rogue-like游戏权威指南
报告日期： 2025年10月25日
作者： 游戏行业分析师，移动部门
引言：硬核手游领域的竖屏革命
截至2025年10月25日，手机游戏领域早已摆脱其仅提供休闲、短暂体验的固有印象。如今的市场由一群成熟且眼光独到的玩家所定义，他们要求的是能够无缝融入移动优先生活方式的、具有深度和丰富策略性的游戏体验。这催生了“竖屏革命”——市场对高质量、可单手竖屏操作的游戏需求激增，这类游戏完美契合了玩家在碎片化时间或较长专注时段内的娱乐需求 [1]。
引领这一潮流的正是Rogue-like游戏类型。其核心信条——程序化生成的关卡、永久死亡的高风险以及引人入胜的元进度系统——创造了一种无限可重玩的“再来一局”循环，这与移动平台特性形成了独特的共鸣 [2, 3]。这些游戏奖励技巧、战略思维和毅力，提供了玩家日益在他们的主要游戏设备上寻求的硬核挑战。
然而，2025年的手机Rogue-like市场呈现出明显的两极分化。这是一个由不同盈利哲学相互竞争的领域，从尊重玩家的付费买断制游戏，到道德标准各异的免费游戏（F2P）模式 [4, 5]。要在这个领域中做出明智选择，需要进行审慎的分析。本报告旨在为当今最优秀的竖屏Rogue-like体验提供一份权威指南，秉持“玩家至上”的理念，优先考虑游戏价值、开发者透明度和公平的盈利模式。本分析完全基于2025年的全球市场数据和英文资料，并特意排除了中国大陆独特的生态系统，以便为国际玩家提供一个专注且相关的视角。
第一部分：付费买断制的标杆——一次付费，永久畅玩
本部分推崇手机游戏中最纯粹的卓越形式：付费买断制模式。这些游戏尊重玩家的投入，通过一次性预付费提供完整、无妥协的游戏体验，让玩家免受应用内购买或广告的压力。它们代表了衡量所有其他模式的基准。
深度专题：Slice & Dice — 骰子游戏的战术大师课
《Slice & Dice》堪称现代手机游戏设计的典范，是在战略深度与可控随机性之间取得平衡的大师之作 [6, 7]。其核心概念既简单又巧妙：玩家控制一个由五位英雄组成的队伍，每位英雄都由一个独特且可定制的六面骰子代表。战斗采用回合制，敌人的行动会提前揭示，这使得每一回合都变成一个涉及风险管理和战术决策的复杂“微型谜题” [8]。游戏简约而迷人的像素艺术风格和异常清晰的用户界面使其完美适配竖屏操作，同时也提供了横屏模式以增加灵活性 [1, 8]。
该游戏的盈利模式可以说是2025年手机市场的黄金标准。它采用“试玩后付费”的模式：游戏可免费下载并体验前12个关卡，让玩家充分感受核心机制。之后通过约9美元的一次性应用内购买即可解锁完整的、内容庞大的游戏 [6, 9]。这种方式极大地建立了玩家的信任，让他们能够做出知情的购买决定，并确保了一个忠实的付费用户群体。在一个充斥着不透明F2P系统的行业中，这种透明度如同一股清流。
这次性购买的价值是巨大的。完整版游戏解锁了超过60个英雄职业、近500种独特物品以及300多种难度调整器，提供了惊人水平的可重玩性，在某些方面甚至超越了同类游戏 [8, 10]。尽管一些资深玩家指出，不同难度等级之间的跨度较大，并希望有一个更精细的进阶系统（类似于《杀戮尖塔》的“进阶”等级），但其构建的多样性确保了每一次游戏体验都是全新的 [11]。对于重视纯粹策略和公道价格的玩家而言，《Slice & Dice》是必入之选。
深度专题：Wildfrost — 深度策略的卡牌构筑游戏
对于寻求具有深远战术深度的卡牌构筑体验的玩家来说，《Wildfrost》已在2025年确立了其顶级游戏的地位 [12]。它成功地开辟了自己的市场，通过引入多线战场和创新的“计时”系统，超越了《杀戮尖塔》的基础机制。在《Wildfrost》中，友方和敌方单位都拥有计时器，当玩家打出卡牌时，计时器会减少；一旦计时器归零，单位便会行动 [12, 13]。这一机制将游戏从简单的出牌练习转变为一个复杂的时间谜题，其中回合顺序、单位部署和资源管理至关重要。
遵循着玩家友好的趋势，《Wildfrost》也采用了“先试后买”的模式。玩家可以免费下载并体验游戏的初始部分，通过约6.99美元的一次性应用内购买即可解锁完整游戏 [12, 14, 15]。事实证明，这种模式成功吸引了那些对盲目购买持谨慎态度，但愿意为高质量、完整产品付费的玩家。
移动版本经过特别优化，更新了用户界面以适应小屏幕，并完全支持竖屏模式，使其深度策略玩法能够随时随地进行 [15, 16]。然而，其高质量的动画和复杂的计算可能对设备资源要求较高，有报告称长时间游戏会导致手机发热 [12, 13]。尽管如此，对于拥有性能足够硬件的玩家来说，《Wildfrost》在任何平台上都提供了最具智力挑战性的Rogue-like体验之一。
创新者之选：Vault of the Void
《Vault of the Void》是一款为那些厌恶随机数生成器（RNG）的策略家们量身打造的卡牌构筑游戏 [12, 17]。其设计理念的核心是给予玩家最大限度的信息和控制权。使其脱颖而出的关键机制包括：在遭遇战前能够预览楼层上的所有敌人，在战斗间隙可以随时自由调整牌组，以及一个独特的“威胁”系统，该系统能清晰地显示即将到来的伤害，消除了防御计算中的猜测成分 [17, 18]。
这款游戏是纯粹的付费买断制体验，一次性购买价格约为6.99美元 [19, 20]。为了进一步强化其对公平玩家体验的承诺，游戏还提供了一个完全可选的2.99美元支持者包，该包不提供任何游戏优势 [18]。
然而，对于寻求竖屏体验的玩家来说，存在一个关键的警示。该游戏的App Store页面明确标注其为“专为iPad设计”，并且2025年的许多用户评论提到在手机上的“移动端用户体验一般”，界面会感觉拥挤并导致意外出牌 [20, 21]。游戏的布局严重偏向于更宽的横屏长宽比。虽然它是一款顶级的卡牌构筑游戏，但它不满足竖屏游戏的要求，最好在平板电脑上体验。
其他必备付费游戏
为了构建一个完整的游戏库，另外两款付费竖屏Rogue-like游戏在2025年被视为永恒的经典：
 * Crypt of the NecroDancer (节奏地牢): 这款游戏巧妙地将Rogue-like与节奏游戏融为一体。每一个动作——移动和攻击——都必须与游戏极具感染力的背景音乐节拍同步。这种基于节奏的回合制玩法通过简单的点击控制在移动设备上得到了完美执行，使其成为理想的竖屏体验 [22, 23]。
 * Downwell (下井大战): 极简设计和纯粹、精炼动作玩法的典范。玩家在一个程序化生成的井中下落，使用他们的“枪靴”射击敌人并减缓下落速度。游戏节奏快、紧张刺激，并且完全是竖屏的，使其成为短暂、肾上腺素飙升的游戏时间的完美选择 [23]。
《Slice & Dice》和《Wildfrost》所采用的“试玩后付费”模式的成功，反映了移动市场的日趋成熟。纯付费游戏在以“免费”为默认筛选条件的应用商店中常常面临曝光不足的问题。相反，许多F2P游戏解决了这个问题，但随后必须实施可能带有强制性的盈利系统。试玩模式提供了一种强大的第三条道路：它利用免费上架的可见性吸引广泛的受众，然后通过直接展示游戏质量，将最投入的玩家转化为付费用户。这建立了一种信任基础，并证明了相当一部分移动用户愿意为完整、高质量的产品付费，前提是他们有机会首先验证其价值。
第二部分：免费游戏的先锋——无需花费的卓越体验
尽管付费市场提供了有保障的品质，但2025年的免费游戏领域同样孕育了一些最具创新性和最受欢迎的Rogue-like游戏。然而，要在这一领域取得成功，需要仔细理解每款游戏的盈利模式。本部分将分析最优秀的F2P游戏，并为零氪和微氪玩家提供详细的策略指导。
深度专题：Vampire Survivors — 品类之王的持续统治
《Vampire Survivors》不仅仅是一款游戏；它是一种现象。它以一己之力创造并定义了“子弹天堂”这一子类型，其影响力遍及整个行业 [23, 24]。其核心玩法循环看似简单：玩家用一根手指移动角色，而武器会自动开火。这种极简的控制方案使其成为终极的竖屏游戏，专为单手操作而设计 [1, 25]。在越来越密集的怪物潮中生存、收集经验宝石，并将武器和被动技能组合发展成清屏的灾难性力量，这个令人上瘾的循环在2025年末依然像它刚推出时一样引人入胜 [3, 23]。
2025年该游戏最重要的进展是即将到来的v1.14版本更新。该更新计划于今年秋季发布，将引入备受期待的、最多支持四名玩家的在线合作模式，将游戏从其单人及本地合作的根基上进一步扩展 [26, 27]。虽然移动端移植总体上非常出色，但玩家应注意两个常见的抱怨：在游戏后期图形最密集时会出现明显的输入延迟，以及缺少中途保存功能，这对于可能被中断的玩家来说可能令人沮丧 [25]。
零氪与微氪玩家指南
 * 盈利模式： 《Vampire Survivors》采用了市场上最良心的F2P模式之一。庞大的基础游戏完全免费。收入来自可选的、价格低廉的可下载内容（DLC）包，这些DLC增加了新的角色、关卡、武器和音乐，其功能更像是内容扩展，而非付费致胜的优势 [28, 29]。
 * 零氪（0氪）玩家指南： 基础游戏提供了数十甚至数百小时的内容。零氪玩家的主要进阶路径是高效地刷取金币，用于在“强化”菜单中购买永久升级。为了加速进程，早期最关键的投资是贪婪（更多金币）、成长（更多经验）、运气（改善升级选项和掉落物）以及冷却缩减。一个至关重要的实验功能是能够随时免费重置所有强化点数，让玩家可以无惩罚地重新分配他们的构建 [25]。
 * 微氪（微氪）玩家指南： DLC代表了极高的性价比。推荐的策略是首先玩通并解锁大部分基础游戏内容。在此之后，购买DLC是支持开发者并为游戏注入大量新内容的绝佳方式，从而显著延长其寿命。
深度专题：Shattered Pixel Dungeon — 开源社区的冠军
《Shattered Pixel Dungeon》是社区驱动开发力量的证明。它作为移动平台上传统回合制Rogue-like类型的支柱而存在 [1, 30, 31]。这个项目始于2014年，最初只是为了重新平衡原版《Pixel Dungeon》的一个模组，但在过去十年持续不断的更新中，它已发展成为一款独立、高度打磨且独具特色的游戏 [30, 32, 33]。它以其深度、挑战性和完全没有掠夺性盈利机制而备受赞誉。
该游戏的开发者维护着一个公开的开发路线图，提供了在业界罕见的透明度。2025年的主要更新包括发布了第六个可玩英雄——牧师，并计划在今年晚些时候推出一个设定在矮人城市的新任务，以及对战士职业的平衡性改进 [32]。这种持续的长期支持培养了一个忠诚而热情的玩家社群。
零氪与微氪玩家指南
 * 盈利模式： 《Shattered Pixel Dungeon》采用了一种独特的跨平台盈利策略。在安卓的Google Play商店中，该游戏完全免费，没有任何广告或应用内购买 [30, 34, 35]。这是一个真正的热情项目。而在苹果的App Store中，它作为一款付费游戏出售，一次性价格为4.99美元，以覆盖开发和平台成本 [36, 37]。
 * 零氪（0氪）玩家指南（安卓平台）： 由于没有任何付费机制，本指南将完全专注于游戏策略。建议新玩家从战士职业开始，因为他初始的护甲和更高的耐久度使得惩罚性的早期楼层更容易应对 [38]。关键的入门策略包括：在远离敌人的安全楼层通过试用来识别药水；利用门道对追击的怪物发动突袭；以及仔细观察敌人的攻击模式，以判断何时战斗、何时逃跑。该游戏的学习曲线陡峭，鼓励玩家查阅网上大量由社区编写的指南 [39, 40]。
分析：Shadow of the Depth — 一个充满希望但需谨慎对待的案例
《Shadow of the Depth》出自备受赞誉的《元气骑士》开发商凉屋游戏之手，是一款基础扎实的俯视角动作Rogue-like游戏 [41, 42]。游戏拥有快节奏、令人满意的砍杀战斗，一种阴郁的手绘艺术风格，以及一个通过超过140种被动技能、角色特定天赋和符文系统相结合的深度构筑系统 [43, 44]。
然而，其盈利模式更偏向于F2P光谱中更具侵略性的一端。游戏免费，包含广告和应用内购买，主要销售额外的可玩角色以及解锁它们所需的付费货币 [41, 45]。2025年的几份用户评论批评了他们所谓的“欺骗性收费行为”。具体来说，付费货币包的定价方式使得玩家无法用单次购买恰好解锁一个英雄，从而被迫购买一个更大、更昂贵的包，最终剩下尴尬数量的货币——这是一种旨在鼓励进一步消费的经典F2P策略 [44]。虽然核心玩法很强大，但这种做法可能会疏远习惯了更透明模式的玩家。此外，其俯视角动作玩法最适合横屏操作，并且没有证据表明它支持专门的竖屏模式，这使其不符合用户的核心要求 [41, 45]。
零氪与微氪玩家指南
 * 零氪（0氪）玩家指南： 最可行的零氪路径是完全掌握初始角色——战士亚瑟 [43, 44]。零氪玩家的成长与符文系统挂钩；符文可以通过游戏缓慢获得，或者通过观看激励视频广告更快地获取。利用这个广告系统是零氪玩家随着时间积累力量的主要方式 [41]。
 * 微氪（微氪）玩家指南： 单次最有价值的购买是一次性移除强制广告的内购 [44]。对于那些希望小额消费的玩家，售价0.99美元的“新手包”可能提供了最佳的初始价值 [45]。除非玩家对游戏投入很深并且对定价结构感到满意，否则应谨慎购买较大的货币包。
2025年的F2P Rogue-like领域清晰地展示了开发者理念的光谱。一端是《Vampire Survivors》和《Shattered Pixel Dungeon》，代表了以玩家为中心的方法。前者通过销售更多高质量内容来盈利，将玩家视为顾客。后者在安卓平台上则是一个纯粹的热情项目。另一端，像《Shadow of the Depth》这样的游戏则采用了更传统的F2P机制，通过制造障碍并激励消费来克服这些障碍。这揭示了开发者如何看待他们的受众的根本差异：是作为需要取悦的顾客，还是作为需要盈利的资源。前一种模式的巨大成功表明，市场正日益奖励透明度和价值。
第三部分：市场脉搏——趋势、巨头与未来展望
要全面理解竖屏Rogue-like领域，还必须考虑那些塑造了玩家期望的行业巨头，即使它们并不完全符合单手操作的游戏风格。
房间里的大象：Balatro与对竖屏模式的期待
任何关于2025年Rogue-like场景的讨论都不能不提《Balatro》。这款基于扑克的卡牌构筑游戏是2024年异军突起的独立游戏 sensation，以其巧妙的设计和令人上瘾的协同效应吸引了整个游戏界 [23, 34, 46]。它的成功在2025年Pocket Gamer移动游戏大奖中荣获“玩家选择奖”时得到了官方认可 [47]。
尽管在移动设备上广受欢迎并备受好评，但这款游戏有一个显著的缺点，使其无法成为本报告的顶级推荐：它缺少竖屏模式 [1, 48]。竖屏是移动社区最常要求的功能之一，其目前仅支持横屏的格式对于寻求真正单手体验的玩家来说是一个相当大的障碍。
此外，2025年9月爆出重大新闻：游戏的首个主要内容更新1.1版本将不会在2025年发布 [49, 50]。独立开发者LocalThunk发布了一份情真意切的声明，解释说作为一名“业余开发者”，他希望避免在游戏发布期间困扰他的压力和过度工作，而是以一种健康、可持续的节奏进行开发 [49, 50]。新的时间表很简单：“做完再说”。这个故事已成为业内关于独立开发者健康以及在病毒式成功后如何管理社区期望的重要话题。
荣誉提名与行业传奇
 * Slay the Spire (杀戮尖塔): 这款游戏以一己之力复兴并定义了现代卡牌构筑Rogue-like类型 [12, 23, 30]。它至今仍是平衡性、设计和可重玩性的标杆。虽然其移动端移植非常出色，但用户界面严重偏向于横屏操作，使其不太适合本报告的特定需求。
 * Dead Cells (死亡细胞): 一款将快节奏Rogue-lite动作与类银河战士恶魔城风格的探索和进程无缝结合的杰作 [23, 30, 36]。它是一款拥有惊人内容量的付费游戏，但作为横版卷轴动作平台游戏，它只能在横屏模式下体验。
 * Netflix效应： 2025年一个日益增长的趋势是游戏订阅服务的影响力。特别是Netflix Games，已成为高质量移动游戏的重要发行平台。通过将其订阅服务中包含《Hades》、《Into The Breach》和《Dead Cells》等备受赞誉的游戏，它为玩家提供了另一种获取无内购付费体验的途径，进一步提高了平台上的质量标准 [23, 51]。
结论性分析：手机Rogue-like的未来
2025年末，竖屏Rogue-like类型的状况异常强劲。市场已经足够成熟，能够支持一个由付费买断制杰作和良心免费游戏冠军共同组成的健康生态系统，为眼光独到的玩家提供了比以往任何时候都更多的高质量选择。
几个关键趋势将定义该类型进入2026年的发展。首先，“试玩后付费”模式的成功证明了它是一种可持续且玩家友好的策略，弥合了免费与付费游戏之间的鸿沟。其次，开发者的透明度——无论是通过像《Shattered Pixel Dungeon》那样的公开路线图，还是像《Balatro》那样就延迟进行坦诚沟通——正在成为建立长期社区信任的关键因素。最后，随着开发者认识到移动平台的独特优势，对具有深度机制、竖屏优先体验的需求只会持续增长。虽然像AI驱动的个性化推荐这样的技术将在F2P盈利中变得更加普遍，但成功的最终裁决者将是玩家自己，他们已一再表明，他们会奖励那些尊重他们时间、智慧和钱包的开发者 [5, 52]。
